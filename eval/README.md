# seek eval harness

Behavior comparison tests for the agent loop. Each case fixes a
**prompt** + **expected metrics**; the runner pipes the prompt
through `seek -json` and checks the resulting tool-call stream
against the case's `expect.json`.

This is **not** a unit-test suite — it's a black-box probe of LLM
behaviour against the real DeepSeek API, with all the stochasticity
that implies. A single failing run is signal, not proof; trends
across versions are what matter.

## Layout

```
eval/
├── run.sh          # eval/run.sh [case] [binary]   (defaults: all cases, ./seek)
├── cases/
│   └── <name>/
│       ├── README.md   # what the case probes + the bug it came from
│       ├── prompt.txt  # exact text passed via `seek -p`
│       └── expect.json # PASS/FAIL bounds; see "Metric vocabulary" below
└── results/        # checked-in JSONL of each pass; one row per case
```

## Running

```bash
# Run every case against ./seek
eval/run.sh

# One specific case
eval/run.sh tool-args-hallucination

# Against a different binary (e.g. an older release for A/B comparison)
eval/run.sh tool-args-hallucination /tmp/seek-baseline
```

The runner appends one row to `results/<UTC-date>-<binary-version>.jsonl`
per case it executed, e.g.:

```json
{"case":"tool-args-hallucination","pass":true,"metrics":{"unknown_field_errors":0,"think_calls":1,"turns":4},"prompt_tokens":12834,"completion_tokens":612,"elapsed_s":21}
```

## Metric vocabulary (extracted by `run.sh` from the JSONL stream)

| Metric | What it counts |
|---|---|
| `unknown_field_errors` | `tool_end` events whose `error` contains `unknown field` |
| `think_calls` | `tool_start` events with `name=think` |
| `total_tool_calls` | every `tool_start` event |
| `read_calls` | `tool_start` events with `name=read` |
| `grep_calls` | `tool_start` events with `name=grep` |
| `list_dir_calls` | `tool_start` events with `name=list_dir` |
| `git_calls` | `tool_start` events with `name=git` |
| `git_subcommand_dupes` | `tool_end` events for `git` whose result contains `repeated from args` — the model repeated the subcommand as `args[0]` and the tool auto-fixed it; counts the construction mistake at zero behavioral cost (see `eval/cases/git-subcommand-shape/README.md`) |
| `probe_reads` | `tool_end` events for `read` whose result contains `0 lines emitted` **and** `from line` — a read past EOF that returned nothing, i.e. the model was probing because it couldn't tell whether more pages existed (see `docs/test-plan-read-tool.md` §3.2) |
| `write_refusals` | `tool_end` events for `write` whose error contains `write refused` — the fsobserve blind-overwrite guard refusing (see `internal/fsobserve/fsobserve.go` `Explain`) |
| `turns` | `turn_end` events |
| `completion_tokens` | cumulative generated tokens (`agent_end.completion_tokens`) — verbosity/thoroughness proxy |
| `review_line_refs` | count of `line N` / `LN` references in the assistant's text — rough "how many findings" proxy (deliberately ignores severity words so it doesn't echo the effort vocabulary) |

Bounds in `expect.json` use the prefix to declare direction:

| Key shape | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `max_<metric>` | metric must be `≤ value` |
| `min_<metric>` | metric must be `≥ value` |
| `exact_<metric>` | metric must equal value |

`expect.json` also carries scalar config:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `description` | human-readable summary |
| `max_turns` | passed to `seek -max-turns` |

## Adding a case

1. `mkdir eval/cases/<name>` (kebab-case)
2. `README.md` explaining what behaviour the case probes — link to the original failing session, bug, or PRD claim if any
3. `prompt.txt` — the exact `-p` input; multi-line is fine
4. `expect.json` — start with `{"max_turns": 10}` and add bounds as you learn what good vs. bad looks like

Optional per-case hooks (run from the repo root, same cwd as the seek invocation):

- `setup.sh` — prepare fixtures before the run, e.g. copy `fixtures/` into `eval/tmp/<case>/` so the model can mutate them without dirtying the repo.
- `teardown.sh` — clean up after the run; runs even when the invocation failed.

## When to read results

Results are checked into git so you can `git log eval/results/` and watch how the agent's behaviour drifts as the codebase, prompts, or model versions change. A single PASS does not mean the bug is fixed; a sustained PASS rate across many runs does.

## Cost

Each pass is one full `seek` invocation against DeepSeek's API. Budget roughly **$0.02–0.05 per case** depending on prompt length and tool-call fan-out. The full 3-case suite is well under $0.20.

Rows also carry `cache_hit_tokens` (for cost accounting — see `docs/test-plan-read-tool.md` §3.3) and `final_text` (joined assistant text, capped at 2000 chars, for offline gold-answer scoring).
